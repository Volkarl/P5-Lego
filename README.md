# Lego Projects
Collection of programs for the device.

## Compilation
Run ```make all``` to compile, ```make clean``` to clear the folder.
To push it to the NXT, make sure you have the USB cable attached and it is in flash mode (While in main menu, hold down enter and left until it shuts down - proceed to turn on), then run ```./appflash.sh```.
If you want to combine these you can chain them by doing ```make all && ./appflash.sh```.
